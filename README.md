<h1>Production Distribution Management System</h1>

Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js (Basic)

<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
Developed a full-stack web application to manage and track the production and distribution of crown wheels and pinions, which are essential components used in gearboxes for trucks and cars. The system streamlines the production process by providing a centralized platform for monitoring and recording data from various production stages.

<h3>Key Features:</h3>

<h4>End-to-End Production Tracking:</h4> Implemented a comprehensive system to track the production flow from raw material processing in the Metal Cutting Shop, through Heat Treatment, to the final grinding stage. This ensures transparency and accountability at every step of the manufacturing process.

<h4>Daily Production Records:</h4>  Designed and integrated functionality to record and store daily production data. This allows managers to easily monitor production volumes, identify bottlenecks, and ensure that targets are met.

<h4>Data Management:</h4>  Utilized MySQL for robust data storage, enabling the application to efficiently manage and query large volumes of production data. Each shop's data—Metal Cutting, Heat Treatment, and Grinding—is stored systematically with date-wise entries, facilitating easy retrieval and analysis.

<h4>User Interface:</h4>  Developed a user-friendly interface using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, ensuring that the application is accessible and intuitive for users at all levels of technical expertise.

<h4>Backend Integration:</h4>  Used Node.js and Express.js to build a scalable and efficient backend that handles data processing, storage, and retrieval operations, ensuring smooth performance even with a high volume of data.

<h3>Impact and Learning:</h3>

The system has significantly improved the efficiency of production tracking, reducing manual errors and providing real-time insights into production metrics.

Gained experience in full-stack development, particularly in integrating front-end and back-end technologies to create a cohesive and functional application.

Enhanced understanding of manufacturing processes and the application of technology to solve real-world industry problems.
